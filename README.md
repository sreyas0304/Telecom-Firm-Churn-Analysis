# Telecom-Firm-Churn-Analysis

The End-to-End Churn Analysis project aims to tackle customer attrition by leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. Focused on a telecom firm's customer data, the project encompasses creating a robust ETL process using SQL Server to manage and transform raw data. This data is then visualized through Power BI, offering insights at demographic, geographic, and service levels to understand customer behavior and identify churn patterns. The analysis extends to developing a churn prediction model using Random Forest in Python, enabling the anticipation of future churners. This comprehensive approach not only helps in visualizing and analyzing key metrics such as total customers, churn rate, and new joiners but also aids in strategic decision-making to enhance customer retention and loyalty across various industries.
